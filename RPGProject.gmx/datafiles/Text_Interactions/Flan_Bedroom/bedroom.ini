0="Hello there! Welcome to Flan and Oat. I'm the narrator, and I'll be popping in and out of your adventures as you go along to provide friendly tips and advice. For now though, there's a few things you need to know. Press WASD to move, press E to interact with NPCs or the environment, and press the number keys to respond to textboxes. See how the choices below are numbered from 1 to 3? Sometimes you'll see more, sometimes you'll see less, but in this case, you have 3 choices to respond. When you're ready, press 1, 2, or, 3, and you can begin playing!"
